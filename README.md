# Language Model Training and Inference using GPT-2

This script demonstrates language model training and inference using GPT-2 within a Colab environment, providing step-by-step instructions and explanations:

## Setup and Dependencies

1. **Install Libraries**: Installs necessary libraries like torch, transformers, torchtext, sentencepiece, pandas, and tqdm.

2. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Loads a dataset from Hugging Face ("QuyenAnhDE/Diseases_Symptoms") and processes it into a pandas DataFrame.

## Model Setup and Training

3. **Tokenization and Model Initialization**: Initializes GPT-2 tokenizer and model.

4. **Dataset Preparation**: Defines a custom Dataset class (`LanguageDataset`) for ingesting data into the model, including tokenization and formatting.

5. **Training Loop**: Trains the GPT-2 model using the custom dataset, splitting the data into train and validation sets. Implements the training loop, calculating losses, and optimizing model parameters.

6. **Hyperparameters and Training Metrics**: Defines hyperparameters like batch size, epochs, learning rate, and GPU utilization. Monitors training and validation losses, recording training duration.

## Inference

7. **Inference Example**: Performs inference on the trained model by generating text based on user input ("Kidney Failure"). Generates sequences using GPT-2 with specified settings (max_length, num_return_sequences, top_k, top_p, temperature, repetition_penalty).

## Usage

- **Requirements**: Ensure the installation of required packages (`torch`, `transformers`, etc.) before executing the script.
- **Data Handling**: Modify dataset loading and preprocessing for different datasets.
- **Model Customization**: Adjust model hyperparameters and training configurations.
- **Inference Modification**: Customize inference by changing input text and generation settings for different outputs.

The provided code offers a detailed demonstration of using GPT-2 for language model training and inference, allowing customization and modification for various NLP tasks and datasets.
